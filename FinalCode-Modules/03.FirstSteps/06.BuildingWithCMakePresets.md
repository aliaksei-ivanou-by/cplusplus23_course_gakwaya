# Building a C++23 Project with CMake Presets on Windows and Linux

When working on a C++23 project using CMake, using CMake presets simplifies the build process. This guide will walk you through setting up your environment, installing dependencies, and building your project using CMake presets on Windows (with MSVC) and Linux (with GCC and Clang) on the terminal.

## 1. Start a Developer Prompt (Windows) or Open a Terminal (Linux)

### Windows (MSVC)

Before running CMake, you need to start a Visual Studio Developer PowerShell with 64-bit support:

1. Open a regular PowerShell window.
2. Run the following command:

```powershell
& "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\Common7\Tools\Launch-VsDevShell.ps1" -Arch amd64
```

Note: Replace "Community" with "Professional" or "Enterprise" if you are using those editions of Visual Studio.

To ensure you are using the correct 64-bit architecture, run:

```powershell
$env:PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE
```

This should display something like AMD64. You should look for a 64 in there. It means you are using a 64-bit architecture.

### Linux (GCC or Clang)

Simply open a terminal and ensure your compiler is installed.

To check GCC:

```sh
clang++ --version
```

## 3. Set Up the VCPKG Environment Variable

We have set it up in the installation sections, but you can verify the value both on Windows Powershell and Linux terminal as shown below: 

### Windows

```powershell
$env:VCPKG_ROOT
```

### Linux

```sh
echo $VCPKG_ROOT
```


## 4. Navigate to the Project Directory

```sh
cd F:\OnlineCourses\Cpp23Masterclass\CodeLive\02.EnvironmentSetup\01.Project_template_modules
```

Your project directory should contain:

```
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── CMakePresets.json
├── main.cpp
├── utilities.ixx
├── vcpkg.json
└── .gitignore
```

## 5. Install Required Dependencies Using VCPKG

Here we won't be installing the dependencies manually through vcpkg because CMake is configured to pull them downn through vcpkg when we configure the project. But if you had to do it, you would do it like shown below:

### Windows

```powershell
vcpkg install fmt:x64-windows sfml:x64-windows
```

### Linux

```sh
vcpkg install fmt:x64-linux-dynamic sfml:x64-linux-dynamic
```

`x64-windows` and `x64-linux-dynamic` known as triplets in vcpkg are used to specify the target architecture and the type of libraries to install. The first one specifies that we want the libraries for Windows 64-bit, and the second one specifies that we want the dynamic libraries for Linux 64-bit. This is taken care of by the CMake Preset file in projects that we have done previously. Again, in this case, we don't need to manually download those dependencies because CMake will do it for us when we configure the project.

## 6. Configure the Project Using CMake Presets

### List the Available Presets

```sh
cmake --list-presets
```
This should display the `cl` preset on Windows and `linux-gcc` and `linux-clang` presets on Linux.

### Select a Preset on Windows (MSVC)

```powershell
cmake --preset=cl
```

### Select Linux (GCC)

```sh
cmake --preset=linux-gcc
```

### Select Linux (Clang)

```sh
cmake --preset=linux-clang
```
Selecting a preset configures the project with the necessary flags and settings for the specified compiler. If you chose `cl`, the project is configured for MSVC on Windows. If you chose `linux-gcc`, the project is configured for GCC on Linux. If you chose `linux-clang`, the project is configured for Clang on Linux. The build files should then be generated in a `.build` directory specific to the selected preset. The windows ones will go in `.build\cl` and the linux ones will go in `.build\linux-gcc` or `.build\linux-clang`. This is all configured in the project `CMakePresets.json` file. If you choose to build the project through Visual Studio Code like we've been doing previously, it selects a present once you go to `View > Command Palette > CMake: Select Configure Preset` and choose the preset you want to use.

## 7. Build the Project with the Selected Preset

### Listing the Build Presets

You can list the available build presets using:

```sh
cmake --list-presets=build
```
You will use one of the listed build presets as a value for the `--preset` option in the following steps. You can either choose to build a debug or release version of the project. The difference between the two is that the debug version includes debugging information and is slower, while the release version is optimized for performance. You should use debug builds during development and release builds for distribution.

### Windows

#### Debug build

```powershell
cmake --build --preset=cl-debug
```

#### Release build

```powershell
cmake --build --preset=cl-release
```

### Linux (GCC)

#### Debug build

```sh
cmake --build --preset=linux-gcc
```

### Linux (Clang)

#### Debug build

```sh
cmake --build --preset=linux-clang
```

## 8. Run the Executable

### Windows

#### Run Debug build

```powershell
.build\cl\Debug\Rocket.exe
```

#### Run Release build

```powershell
.build\cl\Release\Rocket.exe
```

### Linux (GCC or Clang)

#### Run Debug build

```sh
./build/linux-gcc/Rocket  # If built with GCC
./build/linux-clang/Rocket  # If built with Clang
```

## Summary

1. Start a Developer PowerShell (Windows) or open a terminal (Linux).
2. Ensure the correct architecture (AMD64 or x86_64).
3. Set up the VCPKG_ROOT environment variable.
4. Navigate to the project directory.
5. Install required dependencies (fmt and SFML).
6. Configure the project using CMake presets (cl, linux-gcc, or linux-clang).
7. Build using debug or release presets.
8. Run the compiled executable.

## Conclusion

This exercise is meant to familiarize you with using CMake presets to simplify the build process for C++ projects on the terminal. This is useful if you just want a quick way to build the project, but it falls short of the convenience of an IDE. However, it is a powerful tool for automation and scripting, especially in CI/CD pipelines. Experiment with different presets and build configurations to understand how CMake can streamline your development workflow.
