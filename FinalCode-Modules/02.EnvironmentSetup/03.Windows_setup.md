# Setting Up a Modern C++ Development Environment on Windows

Windows is a popular platform for C++ development, with many tools and IDEs available. This guide will help you set up a modern C++ development environment on Windows using Visual Studio Code, CMake, Ninja, and vcpkg. We will install the Visual Studio IDE (different from Visual Studio Code) and integrate the compiler it provides with Visual Studio Code, CMake, and vcpkg. Let's get started!

## 1. Install Visual Studio (Required)

Visual Studio is the recommended IDE for C++ development on Windows. It includes the MSVC compiler, debugger, and build tools. We won't be using this IDE directly in the course, but will use the compiler and debugger that it provides. To install:

- Download and install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).
- Double click on the downloaded installer to start the installation process.
- Select the "**Desktop development with C++**" workload during installation.
  - This workload includes the necessary tools for C++ development.
- Once installed, open Visual Studio and see it opens correctly.
- You can now close Visual Studio as we will not be using it directly.
- Confirm that you have access to the cl.exe compiler: 
  - Go to the start menu
  - Search for "Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022" or "Developer PowerShell for VS 2022" or something similar
  - Open the command prompt or PowerShell
  - Type `cl.exe` and press Enter
  - You should see the compiler version information, something like below:
    ```
    PS C:\Users\UserName\source\repos> cl.exe
    Microsoft (R) C/C++ Optimizing Compiler Version 19.41.34123 for x86
    Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.  All rights reserved.
    ```
  - If you see the compiler version information, you have successfully installed Visual Studio and the compiler. If you don't see this information, please check the installation steps again.

## 2. Install CMake (Latest Version)

CMake is essential for building C++ projects. Download and install the latest version from [CMake's official site](https://cmake.org/download/). After installation, do the following: 
- Add CMake to your system PATH during installation.
- Verify the installation by running `cmake --version` in a new terminal or powershell window. You should see the installed version of CMake like below: 
  ```
    PS C:\Users\UserName> cmake --version
    cmake version 3.30.2
    CMake suite maintained and supported by Kitware (kitware.com/cmake).
  ```
- If you see the installed version of CMake, you have successfully installed CMake. If you don't see this information, please check the installation steps again.

## 3. Install Ninja (Build System)

Ninja is a fast build system used with CMake. Download it as part of [WinLibs](https://winlibs.com/). Winlibs is a project that provides a set of C++ tools but we just need access to the Ninja tool that comes with it. It also gives us access to other compilers like GCC and Clang on Windows, but we'll just be happy to use the MSVC compiler that comes with the Visual Studio IDE. 
- Download the latest [WinLibs zip file](https://github.com/brechtsanders/winlibs_mingw/releases/download/14.2.0posix-12.0.0-ucrt-r3/winlibs-i686-posix-dwarf-gcc-14.2.0-llvm-19.1.7-mingw-w64ucrt-12.0.0-r3.zip) (latest at the time of writing).

- Extract the downloaded zip file to a folder (e.g., `C:\mingw64`).
- Add the `C:\mingw64\bin` folder to your system PATH.
- That path gives you access to the Ninja executable, together with other tools that come with WinLibs.
- Verify the installation by running `ninja --version` in a new terminal or powershell window. You should see the installed version of Ninja like below:
  ```
    PS C:\Users\UserName> ninja --version
    1.12.1
  ```

## 4. Install git (Version Control System)

Git is a popular version control system used by many developers. Download and install it from [Git's official site](https://git-scm.com/). After installation, do the following:

- Add Git to your system PATH during installation.
- Verify the installation by running `git --version` in a new terminal or powershell window. You should see the installed version of Git like below:
  ```
    PS C:\Users\UserName> git --version
    git version 2.34.1.windows.1
    ```
- If you see the installed version of Git, you have successfully installed Git. If you don't see this information, please check the installation steps again.
- Configure Git with your name and email address using the following commands:
  ```
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  git config --global user.email "
    ```
- Replace "Your Name" and "Your Email" with your actual name and email address.
- Verify the configuration by running the following commands:
  ```
  git config --global user.name
  git config --global user.email
  ```
- You should see your name and email address printed on the screen.
- If you see your name and email address, you have successfully configured Git. If you don't see this information, please check the configuration steps again.
- With git, now you can clone repositories, commit changes, and push code to remote repositories. Don't worry if you are not familiar with these terms; we will cover them in the course.
  

## 5. Install vcpkg (Package Manager)

vcpkg is a package manager for C++. It gives us the ability to download third-party packages and use them in our own projects. Very powerful stuff! We will install it through Git. To install it:

- Open a new terminal or PowerShell window.
- Change into the root directory (e.g., `C:\`). I would recommend you do to follow up well with the course.
- Download vcpkg through git with the following command: 
- Run the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
    ```
- This will download and create a new folder named `vcpkg` in the root directory.
- Change into the `vcpkg` directory with the following command:
    ```bash
    cd vcpkg
    ```
- Run the following command to bootstrap vcpkg:
    ```bash
    bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
    ```
- This will build the vcpkg executable.
- Confirm that you have access to the vcpkg executable by running the following command inside the `vcpkg` directory:
    ```bash
    vcpkg --version
    ```
- You should see the installed version of vcpkg like below:
    ```
    PS C:\vcpkg> vcpkg --version
    2022.01.11-nohash
    ```
- If you see the installed version of vcpkg, you have successfully installed vcpkg. If you don't see this information, please check the installation steps again.
- Now, you can use vcpkg to install third-party libraries and use them in your projects. We will cover how this is done through CMake in the course.
- Setup a `VCPKG_ROOT` environment variable to point to the vcpkg directory. This will make it easier to use vcpkg with CMake. On Windows, you can do this by: 
  - Going to the start menu
  - Searching for "Environment Variables"
  - Clicking on "Edit the system environment variables"
  - Clicking on "Environment Variables..."
  - Clicking on "New..." under the "System variables" section
  - Adding a new variable named `VCPKG_ROOT` with the value of the path to the vcpkg directory. In my case, it is `C:\vcpkg`.
  - Clicking "OK" to save the new environment variable.

## 6. Install Visual Studio Code (Required)

Visual Studio Code is a lightweight and powerful code editor that supports C++ development. We will use it to write and build our C++ projects in the course. To install:

- Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Open Visual Studio Code and install the following extensions:
  - C++ Environment Extensions (**Choose one of these**):
    - C++ Extension (from Microsoft)
    - Clang tools (This is one I will use in the course): 
      - Clangd (from LLVM)
      - CodeLLDB (from Vadim Chugunov)
  - CMake Tools (from Microsoft)
  - CMake (from Microsoft)
  - Other extesions I will be using in the course: 
    - Docker (Optional)
    - Dev Containers (Optional)
    - Vim (Optional)
  - You can install these extensions by clicking on the Extensions icon on the left sidebar and searching for them in the Extensions Marketplace.

## 7. Verify Your Installation

To check that everything is set up correctly, open a new Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022 or Developer PowerShell for VS 2022 window and run the following commands. We need to go through the developer prompt or PowerShell to ensure that the environment variables needed for the `cl` compiler are set correctly.:

```bash
cl.exe /?
cmake --version  # Check CMake
ninja --version  # Check Ninja
vcpkg --version  # Check vcpkg
```

If all commands return valid versions, your setup is complete!

## 8. Put It All Together in Visual Studio Code: Building and Running your First C++ Program

If all the setup was successful, you can now use one of the template projects as a starting point. We will be using C++20 Modules as a first class citizen in the course, so you can start with the `01.Project_template_modules` template project.

Open the folder `01.Project_template_modules` in Visual Studio Code and build the project. You can do this by dragging the folder and dropping it into Visual Studio Code or by opening Visual Studio Code and selecting `File > Open Folder...` and selecting the folder.

Our project is using a feature named **CMake Presets** to make it easier to configure and build the project. To make sure everything works as expected selet `View > Command Palette...` and start typing `CMake: Select Configure Preset`. Choose the option when it shows up, and you will be presented with a list of presets. Our starter project is configured to use the Visual C++ compiler on Windows, so that's the preset that will show up and that you should choose.

![CMake Configure Preset Selection](./images/cmake_select_configure_presets.png)

Click on the option saying `Windows cl Builds with Visual C++ on Windows` and your project should start configuration. A terminal window will open at the bottom of Visual Studio Code and you will see the output of the configuration process. Give it a few seconds to complete. If everything goes well, you should see a terminal output message saying that the build files have been written to some location on your file system. Something like below: 

```bash
[cmake] -- Detecting CXX compile features - done
[cmake] -- Configuring done (3.9s)
[cmake] -- Generating done (0.0s)
[cmake] -- Build files have been written to: F:/OnlineCourses/Cpp23Masterclass/CodeLive/02.EnvironmentSetup/01.Project_template_modules/build/cl
```

If you see something different, or if you see an error message, please let me know in the course Q&A section, and I will help you troubleshoot the issue.

At this point I assume that your build files have been generated successfully. Now, let's understand a bit about what CMake just did for us.  From the output, you can see that my initial project is stored in the `F:/OnlineCourses/Cpp23Masterclass/CodeLive/02.EnvironmentSetup/01.Project_template_modules` folder. 

As a result of our configuration, CMake generated a new folder named `build` inside the project folder. This is where the build files are stored. The `cl` folder inside the `build` folder is where the actual build files are stored.

Things are working this way because of the settings stored in the `CMakePresets.json` file in the project folder. This file tells CMake how to configure the project. You don't need to worry or understand all the details of this file right now, but you need to understand and know where your build files are stored; and now you know.  Great!

The next thing to do is to build the project. You can do this by selecting `View > Command Palette...` and start typing `CMake: Build`. Choose the option when it shows up, and you will see the build process in the terminal window. If everything goes well, you should see a message saying that the build was successful. Something like below:

```cmake
...
[build] [1/6] Scanning F:\OnlineCourses\Cpp23Masterclass\CodeLive\02.EnvironmentSetup\01.Project_template_modules\main.cpp for CXX dependencies
[build] [2/6] Scanning F:\OnlineCourses\Cpp23Masterclass\CodeLive\02.EnvironmentSetup\01.Project_template_modules\utilities.ixx for CXX dependencies
[build] utilities.ixx
[build] [3/6] Generating CXX dyndep file CMakeFiles\Rocket.dir\Debug\CXX.dd
[build] [4/6] Building CXX object CMakeFiles\Rocket.dir\Debug\utilities.ixx.obj
[build] utilities.ixx
[build] [5/6] Building CXX object CMakeFiles\Rocket.dir\Debug\main.cpp.obj
[build] [6/6] Linking CXX executable Debug\Rocket.exe
[driver] Build completed: 00:00:01.352
[build] Build finished with exit code 0
```
CMake goes through a series of steps to build the project. And by ***building the project***, I mean that CMake is calling the compiler to compile the source files and link them together to create an executable. The executable in this case is named `Rocket.exe` and is stored in the `Debug` folder inside the `cl` folder. For clarity, the full path to the executable is `F:/OnlineCourses/Cpp23Masterclass/CodeLive/02.EnvironmentSetup/01.Project_template_modules/build/cl/Debug/Rocket.exe` in my case.

The binary named `Rocket.exe` is the executable that you can run. This is the whole point for you going through this course, building binary executables that you or other people can run and get important work done. Visual Studio Code itself  that we are using is a binary executable that gets run when you click or double click on it. The same goes for the `Rocket.exe` binary that we just built.

Now we have the executable, and the next step is to run it. Inside Visual Studio Code, you clikc on the play button at the bottom of the window.

![Run Button](./images/play_button.png)

Clicking that will run the executable and you should see the output of the program in the terminal window. If everything goes well, you should see the output of the program in the terminal window. Something like below:

```
PS F:\OnlineCourses\Cpp23Masterclass\CodeLive\02.EnvironmentSetup\01.Project_template_modules\build\cl\Debug> ."F:/OnlineCourses/Cpp23Masterclass/CodeLive/02.EnvironmentSetup/01.Project_template_modules/build/cl/Debug/Rocket.exe"
Hello, World!
```

The output of the program is `Hello, World!`, but the output from the terminal clearly states that it is the binary file named `Rocket.exe` that is being run, and it is stored in the `build/cl/Debug/`, from the perspective of the project root folder. The project root folder is `F:/OnlineCourses/Cpp23Masterclass/CodeLive/02.EnvironmentSetup/01.Project_template_modules` in my case.

## 9. Debugging C++ and Running Things Like a Pro in Visual Studio Code

Most people would stop at what we've done in the previous steps and be happy with it. But to really take advantage of what Visual Studio Code has to offer, and combine that with the top-notch tools that we installed, we neeed to set up debugging and see some quick ways to get things done through shortcuts.

To make sure we're off the same starting point, I assume your root folder looks like shown below: 

```
  ├── 01.Project_template_modules/
  │   ├── CMakeLists.txt
  │   ├── CMakePresets.json
  │   ├── main.cpp
  │   ├── utilities.ixx
  │   ├── vcpkg.json
  │   └── build
```
It just contains our project files and the `build` folder. Nothing else. If you have other files, you can delete them and make sure you have only the files listed above. 

Click on the `Run and Debug` icon on the left sidebar of Visual Studio Code. It looks like a play button with a bug on it.

![Run and Debug Icon](./images/run_and_debug.png)

Because we have no configurations set up yet, you should be given the option to create one by clicking on the `create a launch.json file` link. Click on it and you will be presented with a list of configurations to choose from. By default will choose a default configuration for you an put that in the generated `launch.json` file as shown below.

![Choose a Configuration](./images/code_lldb_launch.png)

If it doesn't for some reason choose the `CodeLLDB: Launch` configuration as shown in the image above. It is working this way because we installed the `CodeLLDB` extension earlier. This extension is what teaches Visual Studio Code how to understand and debug C++ code. It is not the only one though. Many people also use the `C++ Extension` from Microsoft to debug C++ code. You can choose that if you prefer. They mostly work the same, but I prefer `CodeLLDB` because it is more helpful in terms of suggestions and code completion. 

Back to business. My genenerated `launch.json` file looks like below:

```json
{
{
    // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
    // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
    // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
    
        {
            "type": "lldb",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Debug",
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/<executable file>",
            "args": [],
            "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}"
        }
    ]
}
```

It is mostly fine, and we just need to replace the `<executable file>` with the path to the executable file that we want to debug. **${workspaceFolder}** is a Visual Studio Code variable that represents the root folder of the project.

In our case, the executable file is `Rocket.exe` and it is stored in the `build/cl/Debug/` folder. So, we replace `<executable file>` with `build/cl/Debug/Rocket.exe`. The updated `launch.json` file looks like below:

```json
{
{
    // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
    // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
    // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
    
        {
            "type": "lldb",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Debug",
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/build/cl/Debug/Rocket.exe",
            "args": [],
            "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}"
        }
    ]
}
```

Make sure you save the `launch.json` file after making the changes. With this in place, now you can go to the Run Menu and click on `Start Without Debugging` or press `Ctrl + F5` on your keyboard to run the program. Doing so will run the program and you should see the output in the terminal window.

Now we have all we need to build and debug C++ programs in Visual Studio Code. Debugging is a process through which you can run your program step by step, inspect variables, and see what is happening in your program. You can think of it as way to put your program in slow motion and see what is happening at each step. In the root folder of our project, we have a `main.cpp` file that contains the code that is executed first when our C++ program is run. The file looks like shown below:

```cpp
/*
    . Project description
        . Topic #1
        . Topic #2
*/

#include <fmt/format.h>
import utilities;

int main(){
    fmt::print("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Don't worry too much about the code for now. We'll learn about it in the course. What I want you to see is how to freeze the program and make it execute in slow motion. First change the code inside the {} to be as shown below:

```cpp    

int main(){
    fmt::print("Hello, World!\n");
    fmt::print("one\n");
    fmt::print("two\n");
    fmt::print("three\n");
    return 0;
}
```

The idea is that the program will print `Hello, World!`, and then print `one`, `two`, and `three` on separate lines. Becuse we have changed things in the code, we need to rebuild the program. You can do this by going to View > Command Palette... and typing `CMake: Build`. Choose the option when it shows up and the program will be rebuilt.

![CMake Build](./images/cmake_build.png)

One thing to notice is that Visual Studio code also gives you shourtcuts we can use to make things happen faster without taking fingers off the keyboard. In this case, hitting `F7` on the keyboard will also build the program. 

Now we have the changes to print `one`, `two`, and `three` baked in the generated `Rocket` executable binary file. We can confirm that by going to the Run Menu and clicking on `Start Without Debugging` or pressing `Ctrl + F5` on the keyboard. You should see the output in the terminal window as shown below: 

```
Hello, World!
one
two
three
```

But wait! It printed everything at once. We want to see it do things in slow motion. This is where debugging comes in. First go back to your `main.cpp` file and decide where you want things to freeze from. That's called a ***breakpoint*** in Developer Speak. You can set a breakpoint by clicking on the left side of the line number where you want the program to freeze. A red dot will appear to show that a breakpoint has been set. The image below shows how it looks if I hover over the line number 11 in the highlited space.

![Before Breakpoint](./images/before_break_point.png)

You can see a grayed out red dot on the left side of the line number. If I click on the red dot it will turn bright red and this will tell the debugger to freeze the program at that point when I run it. 

Now, to run the program in slow motion, you need to go to the Run Menu and click on `Start Debugging` or press `F5` on the keyboard. The program will start running and it will freeze at the breakpoint you set. 

![Debugging Window](./images/debug_window.png)

From the image above, we can see that the program has frozen on line 11 becaue the red dot is surrounded by a yello diamond shape in Visual Studio Code. This is the debugger telling you that the program has frozen at that point. Besides the break point though, you should get familiar with the way Visual Studio Code gives us info about other aspects of our program. On the left, in the `program info` section, we get to see the information our program is working with in real time. We can also see the `Call Stack`, which is a list of functions that have been called to get to the current point in the program. If you look carefully, you'll notice that at line 11, we are in the `main` function from the call stack.

Now, to make the program execute line by line, you just ckick on the `Step Over` button on the top of the window. In the image above, it is highlighted with the text `execute the current line`. If you click on it, line 11 will be executed, you will see `Hello World!` printed in the terminal window, and the program will freeze at line 12. You can keep clicking on the `Step Over` button to make the program execute line by line.

![Step Over Button](./images/line_14.png)

In the image above, we have already executed lines 11, 12, and 13. Line 14 is highlighted to show that it is the next line to be executed. If you click on the `Step Over` button, line 14 will be executed. You can keep doing this until you reach the end of the program.

Please note that the `Step Over` also offers a keyboard shortcut. You can use `F10` on the keyboard to execute the current line.

## 10. Conclusion

In this guide, we set up a modern C++ development environment on Windows using Visual Studio Code, CMake, Ninja, and vcpkg. We installed Visual Studio, CMake, Ninja, Git, vcpkg, and Visual Studio Code. We also learned how to build and run a C++ program in Visual Studio Code and how to debug it. We covered a lot of ground, and I hope you now feel comfortable with the tools and are ready to start using C++ to build amazing projects. If you have any questions or run into any issues, please let me know in the course Q&A section, and I will be happy to help. Happy coding!

In the image above, we have already executed lines 11, 12, and 13. Line 14 is highlighted to show that it is the next line to be executed. If you click on the `Step Over` button, line 14 will be executed. You can keep doing this until you reach the end of the program.

> ⚠️ **Warning:** YOu will need the launch.json file that you set up earlier in other projects that we create as we go through the course. Make sure you copy it over in the root of any new project that you create. This will make it easier to build and debug your programs. If the structure of the project changes, you may need to adapt the path to the executable in the launch.json file.
