# Setting Up Your C++ Development Environment with Docker and VS Code

In this guide, we'll walk through setting up a complete C++ development environment using Docker and Visual Studio Code. This setup works on Windows, Linux, and Mac, allowing you to develop with GCC 14.2.0, Clang 19, modern versions of CMake, Ninja and vcpkg inside a containerized environment.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, you need to install the following:

### Install Docker

**Windows & Mac:**

- Download and install Docker Desktop.
- Enable WSL 2 integration (for Windows users).
- Restart your machine if required.

**Linux:**

- Install Docker using your package manager:
  ```bash
  # Ubuntu/Debian
  sudo apt install docker
  
  # Fedora
  sudo dnf install docker
  
  # Arch
  sudo pacman -S docker
  ```
- Start the Docker service: `sudo systemctl start docker`
- Enable it at boot: `sudo systemctl enable docker`
- Add your user to the Docker group (optional, avoids using sudo):
  ```bash
  sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
  ```
- Log out and back in to apply changes.

### Install Visual Studio Code

- Download and install VS Code.
- Install the following extensions:
  - Remote - Containers (from Microsoft)
  - C/C++ (from Microsoft) or Clangd and lldb (recommended)
  - CMake and CMake Tools

## Pulling and Running the Docker Image

We will use the recommended container image:

`dgakwaya/gcc-clang:latest` (Includes both GCC 14.2 and Clang 18)

This container includes the latest tools when it comes to C++ development:

- GCC 14.2.0
- Clang 19.1.7
- CMake 3.31.6
- Ninja 1.12.1
- Vcpkg (with VCPKG_ROOT set)
- Debuggers: GDB 13.1 and LLDB 19.1.7

### Step 1: Pull the Docker Image

Run the following command to pull the recommended image:

```bash
docker pull dgakwaya/gcc-clang:latest
```

### Step 2: Run the Container

Run the following command, replacing <path_to_code> with your course project directory:

```bash
docker run -it --name cpp_dev -v <path_to_code>:/workspace dgakwaya/gcc-clang:latest
```

Example (Windows):
```bash
docker run -it --name cpp_dev -v D:\Sandbox\The-C-20-Masterclass-Source-Code:/workspace dgakwaya/gcc-clang:latest
```

Example (Linux/macOS):
```bash
docker run -it --name cpp_dev -v ~/The-C-20-Masterclass-Source-Code:/workspace dgakwaya/gcc-clang:latest
```

At this point, you are inside the container and can compile your code using clang++ or g++. You can verify the installed tools by running:

```bash
clang++ --version   # Clang
g++ --version    # GCC
cmake --version # CMake
ninja --version # Ninja
/opt/vcpkg/vcpkg --version # Because vcpkg is installed in /opt/vcpkg
```

## Connecting VS Code to the Container

1. Open VS Code.
2. Click on the green icon at the bottom left corner.
3. Select "Attach to Running Container".
4. Choose cpp_dev (or the name you provided).
5. Open /workspace in the container.

## Put It All Together in Visual Studio Code: Building and Running your First C++ Program

If all the setup was successful, you can now use one of the template projects in the `/workspace` folder inside the container as a starting point. We'll use C++20 Modules as a first-class citizen in the course, so you can start with the 01.Project_template_modules template project.

Open the folder 01.Project_template_modules in Visual Studio Code. You can do this by dragging the folder into Visual Studio Code or by opening Visual Studio Code and selecting `File > Open Folder...` and selecting the folder.

Our project uses **CMake Presets** to configure and build the project easily. To make everything work as expected, select `View > Command Palette...` and start typing `CMake: Select Configure Preset`. Choose the option when it appears, and you'll see a list of presets. For Linux with Clang, select the `Linux Clang++ Builds with the clang++ compiler` preset.

> ⚠️ **Warning:** At this point, if you are using the SFML library from the `vcpkg.json` file, you may get errors stating that some files are missing or not found and that you can install them using `sudo apt-get install ...`. You can just to to your terminal and install the missing packages as suggested. Here is of I got them installed: `apt-get install libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev libudev-dev libgl1-mesa-dev`.

After selecting the preset, your project will begin configuration. A terminal window will open at the bottom of Visual Studio Code showing the output of the configuration process. After a few seconds, you should see a message indicating that the build files have been written, something like:


```bash
[cmake] -- Detecting CXX compile features - done
[cmake] -- Configuring done (3.9s)
[cmake] -- Generating done (0.0s)
[cmake] -- Build files have been written to: /home/daniel/OnlineCourses/Cpp23Masterclass/CodeLive/02.EnvironmentSetup/01.Project_template_modules/build/linux_clang
```

If you see something different or an error message, please ask for help in the course Q&A section.

Now let's understand what CMake did for us. From the output, you can see that the project is stored in `<path_to_course_files>/02.EnvironmentSetup/01.Project_template_modules`.

CMake generated a new folder named `build` inside the project folder where build files are stored. The `clang` folder inside the `build` folder contains the actual build files.

This happens because of the settings in the `CMakePresets.json` file in the project folder, which tells CMake how to configure the project. You don't need to understand all the details right now, just know where your build files are stored.

Next, build the project by selecting `View > Command Palette...` and typing `CMake: Build`. When the build process completes successfully, you should see output similar to:

```cmake
...
[build] [1/6] Scanning /home/daniel/OnlineCourses/Cpp23Masterclass/CodeLive/02.EnvironmentSetup/01.Project_template_modules/main.cpp for CXX dependencies
[build] [2/6] Scanning /home/daniel/OnlineCourses/Cpp23Masterclass/CodeLive/02.EnvironmentSetup/01.Project_template_modules/utilities.ixx for CXX dependencies
[build] utilities.ixx
[build] [3/6] Generating CXX dyndep file CMakeFiles/Rocket.dir/Debug/CXX.dd
[build] [4/6] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/Rocket.dir/Debug/utilities.ixx.obj
[build] utilities.ixx
[build] [5/6] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/Rocket.dir/Debug/main.cpp.obj
[build] [6/6] Linking CXX executable Debug/Rocket
[driver] Build completed: 00:00:01.352
[build] Build finished with exit code 0
```

CMake compiles the source files and links them together to create an executable. The executable is named `Rocket` (no .exe extension on Linux) and is stored in the `Debug` folder inside the `linux_clang` folder. The full path in our example would be `/home/daniel/OnlineCourses/Cpp23Masterclass/CodeLive/02.EnvironmentSetup/01.Project_template_modules/build/linux_clang/Debug/Rocket`.

This executable is the output of your programming efforts. To run it, click the play button at the bottom of the window.

![Run Button](./images/play_button.png)

Clicking this will run the executable, and you'll see the program's output in the terminal window:

```
$ "/home/daniel/OnlineCourses/Cpp23Masterclass/CodeLive/02.EnvironmentSetup/01.Project_template_modules/build/linux_clang/Debug/Rocket"
Hello, World!
```

The output is `Hello, World!`, with the terminal showing that it's running the `Rocket` binary from the `build/linux_clang/Debug/` directory.

## 9. Debugging C++ and Running Things Like a Pro in Visual Studio Code

To take full advantage of Visual Studio Code and the tools we installed, let's set up debugging and learn some shortcuts.

First, ensure your project folder structure looks like this:

```
  ├── 01.Project_template_modules/
  │   ├── CMakeLists.txt
  │   ├── CMakePresets.json
  │   ├── main.cpp
  │   ├── utilities.ixx
  │   ├── vcpkg.json
  │   └── build
```

Click on the `Run and Debug` icon on the left sidebar of Visual Studio Code (it looks like a play button with a bug on it).

![Run and Debug Icon](./images/run_and_debug.png)

Since we don't have configurations yet, click the `create a launch.json file` link and select the `CodeLLDB: Launch` configuration. This works because we installed the `CodeLLDB` extension earlier, which helps Visual Studio Code understand and debug C++ code.

The generated `launch.json` file should look like this:

```json
{
    // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
    // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
    // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "lldb",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Debug",
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/<executable file>",
            "args": [],
            "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}"
        }
    ]
}
```

Replace `<executable file>` with the path to the executable: `build/linux_clang/Debug/Rocket`. The updated file should look like:

```json
{
    // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
    // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
    // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "lldb",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Debug",
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/build/linux_clang/Debug/Rocket",
            "args": [],
            "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}"
        }
    ]
}
```

Save the file. Now you can go to the Run Menu and click on `Start Without Debugging` or press `Ctrl + F5` to run the program.

To see debugging in action, let's modify our `main.cpp` file:

```cpp    
int main(){
    fmt::print("Hello, World!\n");
    fmt::print("one\n");
    fmt::print("two\n");
    fmt::print("three\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Rebuild the program using `CMake: Build` from the Command Palette or by pressing `F7`.

Run the program with `Ctrl + F5` to see the output:

```
Hello, World!
one
two
three
```

Now let's debug it step by step. Set a breakpoint by clicking to the left of line 11 in `main.cpp` where a red dot will appear.

To run the program in debug mode, go to the Run Menu and click `Start Debugging` or press `F5`. The program will pause at your breakpoint.

![Debugging Window](./images/debug_window.png)

You can now see the program state in the left panel, including variables and the call stack. To execute line by line, click the `Step Over` button or press `F10`. Each time you step over, the next line executes and the program pauses again.

## 10. Conclusion

In this guide, we set up a modern C++ development environment on Linux using Visual Studio Code, CMake, Ninja, and vcpkg. We installed Clang, CMake, Ninja, Git, vcpkg, and Visual Studio Code. We also learned how to build and run a C++ program in Visual Studio Code and how to debug it.

We covered a lot of ground, and I hope you now feel comfortable with these tools and are ready to start using C++ to build amazing projects. If you have any questions or run into issues, please ask in the course Q&A section.

> ⚠️ **Warning:** You'll need the launch.json file you set up earlier for other projects we create in this course. Copy it to the root of any new project to make building and debugging easier. If the structure of the project changes, you may need to adapt the path to the executable in the launch.json file.
